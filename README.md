## usage
This app is meant to be used via inquirer and node in a source code editor of your choice as a command line application. 

Make sure that you have inquirer installed and required, and you can open up the terminal and start the prompts by entering ``node index.js``. from there users can scroll through a list of options regarding their company database and view the relevant information in a table. Users may also choose to remove or add roles, departments, and employees. 

## composition
This app utilizes several different NPM packages:
- [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
- [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table)
- [mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)

[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) was also installed in order to run on an internal database, while also giving the ability to manipulate database information.
